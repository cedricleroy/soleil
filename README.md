## Rust implementation of the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) with Python bindings

This library is a Rust implementation of the [NREL SPA](https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/spa/) (Solar Position Algorithm).

It serves multiple purposes:

1. Practical example to use and learn Rust.
2. Use Rust from Python example.
3. Provide a fast implementation with a permissive license.

Work is still in progress and the code is not optimized. Preliminary benchmarks shows the implementation is faster than other popular implementations C / Python (Pure Python, Numpy, Numba).
